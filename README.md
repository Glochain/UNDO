![Undo](https://bafkreiemzo22752ojrom5bpfubnomi5uyldvi6rnsak4htqdltaffu6z3i.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)

## Introduction
Community service and volunteer activities can have a positive impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) by promoting sustainable practices, raising awareness, and implementing environmental initiatives. Here are some ways community service can contribute to GHG reduction:

- Tree Planting and Green Spaces: Organize tree planting events and the creation of green spaces within the community. Trees absorb CO2, providing shade, and reducing the need for air conditioning.
- Waste Reduction: Implement waste reduction programs, including recycling and composting. Encourage responsible waste disposal and educate the community on proper recycling practices.
- Energy Efficiency: Offer energy efficiency workshops or programs to help community members reduce energy consumption in their homes. This may include tips on weatherizing homes, upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, and adjusting thermostats.
- Public Transportation Promotion: Advocate for and support public transportation initiatives to reduce the number of individual car journeys, which contribute to traffic congestion and emissions.
- Bike Paths and Walking Trails: Promote the development of bike paths and walking trails to encourage non-motorized transportation and reduce the carbon footprint of commuting.
- Community Gardens: Encourage community gardens and local food production, which can reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting food over long distances.
- Renewable Energy Projects: Collaborate with local organizations to support renewable energy projects, such as community solar installations or wind energy initiatives.
- Energy Audits: Offer energy audits to community members, helping them identify areas where energy efficiency can be improved in their homes.
- Green Building Practices: Advocate for and implement green building practices within the community, which can reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions.
- Awareness Campaigns: Raise awareness about climate change and GHG reduction through educational campaigns, workshops, and informational materials.
- Environmental Cleanup: Organize community cleanup events to remove litter and pollution from parks, rivers, and public spaces.
- Eco-Friendly Transportation: Promote carpooling, electric vehicles, and the use of alternative fuels within the community.
- Support Local Eco-Friendly Businesses: Encourage and patronize local businesses that prioritize sustainability and eco-friendly practices.
- Carbon Footprint Tracking: Help community members track and reduce their carbon footprints by using online tools and apps that calculate and monitor emissions.
- Policy Advocacy: Advocate for local and regional policies that promote sustainable practices, such as zoning regulations that support mixed-use developments and reduce urban sprawl.
- Green Events: Organize eco-friendly events and festivals with a focus on reducing waste, energy conservation, and sustainable practices.
- Community Education: Offer workshops and educational sessions on topics such as composting, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy.
- Collaboration: Partner with local schools, governments, and environmental organizations to amplify the impact of community service initiatives.

Community service can play a significant role in building a sustainable and environmentally conscious community by actively reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a culture of eco-friendliness and sustainability.

## Project Overview
This project named Undo uses IPFS / Filcoin's NFT.storage mechanism to store metadata releated to our environmentally degradable data as NFTs. A users can register and contibute towards stoping deforestation through this main activities. Providing good and portable water can help reduce deforestation. People with clean water do not need fire wood to boil their dirty water. Secondly, the provision of green / renewable energy (Solar) for communities to stop the use of gasoline power generating sets that impacts negatively to our enviroment. Stopping the use of timber for construction and providing alternative means of roofing. These data can be useful in the future to ascertain countries with the largest or smallest usecase, what amount of timber is recycled by who. which individual or company is helping to protect our planet and make our enviroment safe. 
co2 was use to store data for climate sustainability.

## What it does
UNDO is a community DAO were contributions are made from lovers of the planet to help tackle the reason for deforestation. Users can upload projects and contributions are made towards the actualization of these projects thereby saving our Planet. Projects areas of interest includes
1. Clean Portable Water
2. Renewal Solar Energy
3. Reforestation / Afforestration
4. Alternative to Timber or Logging for roofing
5. Sustainable agriculture:
6. Corporate responsibility:
7. Education and awareness:
